### 👋 Hello World, I'm James Brace.
I am an IT professional making the shift into software engineering.  My journey began with streamlining processes and scripting for efficiency in my team. I completed my bachelor's in Software Development in 2022, where my focus leaned towards web development and UI/UX courses. Now, post-graduation, I'm pursuing a career in these fields.

💻 I specialize in:

- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Build Tools: Webpack
- Responsive Design: Flexbox, Grid
- Testing: Jest

🌐 Constantly exploring new technologies and best practices to stay at the forefront of web development.

📈 Currently leveling up in:
- API's
- Web Components
- Data Structures and Algorithms

🎨 When I'm not coding, I am spending time with my growing family, looking for inspiration on sites like dribbble.com or diving into the latest in web development through articles and documentation.
